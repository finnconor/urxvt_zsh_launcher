# urxvt_zsh_launcher 

A small collection of scripts for creating a zsh based launcher in
urxvt.  More, specifically it is a zsh shell launched in urxvt which
automatically disowns the executed child process before automatically
closing the urxvt terminal. Furthermore, it imports your preexisting
zsh settings from ~/.zshrc.
